# Without VAOs your typical path is this

## setup:

+ create programs and lookup attribute and uniform locations
+ create buffers
+ create texture

## drawing:

```javascript
for each model
  for each attribute
    bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, model's buffer for attribute)
    vertexAttribPointer(...)
  bindBuffer(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, model's ebo)
  set uniforms and bind textures 
  glDrawElements

```

# With VAOs this changes to

## setup:

+ create programs and lookup attribute and uniform locations
+ create buffers
+ create texture

```javascript
for each model 
  create and bind VAO
    for each attribute
      bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, model's buffer for attribute)
      vertexAttribPointer(...)
    bindBuffer(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, model's ebo)
```
## drawing:

```javascript
for each model
  bindVertexArray(model's VAO)
  set uniforms and bind textures 
  glDrawElements
```
> BTW: WebGL 1 has [VAOs as an extension](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/OES_vertex_array_object/) which [is available on most devices](http://webglstats.com/) and there's a [polyfill](https://github.com/greggman/oes-vertex-array-object-polyfill) you can use to just make it look like it's everywhere so if you're used to using VAOs I'd suggest using the polyfill.

# How does an EBO will know from which buffer to take the data?

EBO's don't take data from buffers they just specify indices. Attributes take data from buffers. Attributes record the current ARRAY_BUFFER binding when you call vertexAttribPointer. In other words

```javascript
gl.bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, bufferA);
gl.vertexAttribPointer(positionLocation, ...);
gl.bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, bufferB);
gl.vertexAttribPointer(normalLocation, ...);
gl.bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, bufferC);
gl.vertexAttribPointer(texcoordLocation, ...);
```

In this case positions will come from bufferA, normals from bufferB, texcoords from bufferC. That's the same with or without VAOs. The difference between VAOs and no VAOs is whether attribute state (and EBO binding) are global or per VAO.
